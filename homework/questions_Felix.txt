1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
ls shows you to contents of the directory you are currently in
cd allows you to move between directories
mkdir creates a new directory in the directory you are currently in
clear clears the terminal window and makes it seem like you are just opening it. 
ssh allows you to remotely access another computer for files
mv moves or renames a file to a new location.
My computer terminal is in powershell, but I typically use gitbash.

2. Do you have pets? What kind?
I have 1 dog and 5 koi. There's also 4 stray adult cats and 2 kittens that like to hang out in my backyard.

3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
Locate where that error is and attempt to fix it. If it is a syntax error, then the error will be easy to spot and easy to fix. If it is a runtime or logic error, then it will be harder to locate, but relatively easy to fix.

4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
One of my classmates in my AP Calculus AB course stood up to sharpen his pencil. The classroom only had a manual sharpener and they stood there for like 2 minutes trying to figure out how to sharpen it. Eventually, the teacher had to help them do so.

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A python script is essentially a set of instructions that you have the computer follow, which can include performing arithmetic, writing out things, or evaluating things.

Comment: Sorry for not answering these questions, it somehow never even occurred to me to open this file up to check for content.
